We realized something has to be done and this started as a social project in early 2020. F&T Nature is now an incubated start-up at UCIE, UPES. From a simple question of “why not”, passionate team of students and mentors constructed a solution to the plastic waste from single use PET plastic bottles. Having qualified multiple events and received overwhelming response from all he stakeholders, we are now working towards our final stage of testing, certifications and getting ready to do our part.\"",
